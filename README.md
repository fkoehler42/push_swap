# Push_swap

Push_swap is a program that takes a stack of integers in parameters and sort it with a limited set of instructions and a second stack.

You can add the -v flag to see the two stacks at each step of sorting, or the -i flag to sort the stack yourself in an interactive mode !

Usage: ./push_swap [-vi] [0 15 -42...]
